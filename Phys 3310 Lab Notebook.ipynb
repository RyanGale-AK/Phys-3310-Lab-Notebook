    "\n",
    "Alligator clips display a decaying reactance and resistance approaching very high frequencies as we expect.  However neither are strictly decreasing from small frequency, there is a peak in both measurements.  I am not sure what this peak is from, maybe the poor connection of the alligator clip is causing interference in the circuit.  I will investigate further.\n",

    "Because these results do not follow the expected $X=\\frac{1}{\\omega C}$ relation.  At certain frequency ranges lengths of wire can exhibit inductor behavior and these peak locations correspond to the length of wire exposed (due to where I connect the alligator clips.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Binding Posts.jpg\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The fluctuation in resistance is due to such a low frequency.  The reactance is clearly the main contributor to impedance.  Although it appears to be following the expected $X=\\frac{1}{\\omega C}$ relation well, at around 150 MHz the Reactance mysteriously increases.  I believe this may be new physics outside of the domain described by the above equation.  Further exploration to ensue."
