    "Alligator clips display a decaying reactance and resistance approaching very high frequencies as we expect.  However neither are strictly decreasing from small frequency, there is a peak in both measurements.  I am not sure what this peak is from, maybe the poor connection of the alligator clip is causing interference in the circuit.  I will investigate further.\n",
